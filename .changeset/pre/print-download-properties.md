`doc.properties()` reads what a properties view shows about a document in one call. It returns the Info entries, with the creation and modification dates as ISO 8601, and the XMP packet as text. It also gives the PDF version, page count, file size, whether the file is linearized and tagged, and the fonts the pages use (name, type, embedded, subset, encoding). Encryption comes with the author's permissions, and signatures are counted, never verified. `contains` says whether the file holds JavaScript, attachments or a form. It needs the extract or text module. For Rust callers, `Document::properties()` returns the same as `DocumentProperties`, and `laminapdf-model` gains `Pages::fonts()` and `Document::xmp_packet()`.

The viewer's client gains `properties()`, `printPage(index, { dpi, annotations })` and `fileBytes()`. `printPage` draws a page in the document worker for printing, with annotations as their print flags say, and returns it as a PNG. `fileBytes` returns a linked file's bytes as opened.
