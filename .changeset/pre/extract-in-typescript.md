`doc.extract({ format })` gives a document's text for an LLM or a search index: Markdown or plain text in reading order, the `laminapdf.extract/1` JSON with a box for every block (the same bytes as Rust's `extract_json`), or chunks sized for retrieval. Tables drawn with lines come out as tables, and hidden text is left out. It needs the extract or text module.
