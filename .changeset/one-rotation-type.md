The `rotatePage` op now reads a `/Rotate` stored as an integral real, such as `90.0`, as the rotation the page displays; before, it read 0. `PageBuilder.rotate` now refuses angles other than 0, 90, 180 and 270, as its type says. In the Rust crates, `Rotation` from `laminapdf-syntax` replaces `laminapdf-render`'s `ViewRotation` and the degrees in `RenderPage::rotate`, and `laminapdf_cos::Page` drops `media_box`, `crop_box` and `rotate`: read them, and their strict-mode errors, from `laminapdf-model`'s page view.
