"@laminapdf/sdk": patch
"@laminapdf/wasm": minor

The WASM module's `beginTag` and `beginArtifact` now take a structure type, table scope and artifact kind by name instead of by index, which breaks code that calls the module directly; `@laminapdf/sdk` already calls them that way. `@laminapdf/sdk` also exports the `LineCap`, `LineJoin` and `TableScope` types that `StrokeStyle` and `TagSpec` use, and `laminapdf-build`'s `FillRule`, `LineCap`, `LineJoin`, `BlendMode`, `ArtifactKind` and `TableScope` gain an `ALL` list of their variants.
