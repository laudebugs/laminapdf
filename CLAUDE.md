# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and humans) working in this repository.

## What lamina is

lamina is a platform for anything and everything PDF: creating PDFs from code, parsing and extracting content, rendering, editing, form filling, signing, and transforming documents. The project is in its **research phase** — there is no application code yet. The core language, architecture and scope have not been decided; don't assume them. When they are decided, they'll be recorded as ADRs in `docs/decisions/` and summarized here.

## Working agreements

- **Always work in a git worktree.** Start every piece of work in a new worktree off main (see docs/guidelines/git-workflow.md). The repo is a bare clone; worktrees are folders inside it: `git worktree add -b <type>/<desc> <type>-<desc> main`. Never `git stash` across worktrees; remove the worktree after merge.
- **Pull requests only.** `main` was initialized directly; every change since goes through a branch + PR. Branch names: `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g. `docs/pdf-research`).
- **Review every PR with `/code-review`, then merge.** After opening a PR, run `/code-review high <PR#> --comment` (trivial PRs: `low`), push fixes, reply to each comment with the fixing commit and resolve it; if there were more than 6 findings, run `/code-review low <PR#> --comment` after the fixes. Squash-merge once every thread is resolved and CI is green. See [review and merge process](docs/guidelines/git-workflow.md#7-review-and-merge-process).
- **Conventional Commits** for commit messages: `type(scope): summary`.
- **Document as you go.** Plans go in `docs/plans/`, decisions in `docs/decisions/`, research in `docs/research/`. Update the folder's `README.md` index whenever you add a file.
- **Cite sources.** PDF behavior claims should point to ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0) or another primary source. Clearly label recommendations and opinions.
- **Spec first.** When implementing PDF features, read the relevant research chapter in `docs/research/` and the spec section before writing code. Real-world PDFs are frequently malformed — parsers must be tolerant, writers must be strict.
- **Use the project's skills.** Load the `/rust-best-practices` skill before writing or reviewing any Rust code, and the `/tauri-v2` skill before any Tauri work (`apps/desktop`, `src-tauri`, `tauri.conf.json`, commands, IPC, capabilities, the updater, bundling). Tell subagents to load them too. Where a skill and the guidelines in `docs/guidelines/` disagree, the guidelines win; record the difference in the guideline.
- **Mind licenses.** Many PDF libraries are AGPL or dual-licensed (e.g. iText, MuPDF/PyMuPDF). Don't add a dependency without checking its license.

## Code organization

Conventions that hold whatever the architecture ADRs decide (crate/package names in them are examples):

- [`docs/guidelines/code-organization.md`](docs/guidelines/code-organization.md): layout (`crates/lamina-*`, `packages/` as `@lamina/*`, `apps/`, `fixtures/`, `tools/xtask`, `spikes/` outside every workspace), dependency direction (pure bytes-in/bytes-out core, platform code only at the edges), public API, tests, when to split.
- [`docs/guidelines/rust.md`](docs/guidelines/rust.md): edition 2024, workspace `[lints]`, no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/indexing in libraries, `unsafe` only in edge crates with `// SAFETY:`, `thiserror` errors.
- [`docs/guidelines/typescript.md`](docs/guidelines/typescript.md): strict tsconfig, ESM-only, no Node-only APIs in shared packages, named exports only, Biome, Vitest.

## Commands

Only research spikes exist so far (`spikes/`). They are throwaway-quality APIs used to inform decisions, not the product.

`spikes/pdf-basics/` — the same minimal PDF core in Rust and TypeScript (see its `SPEC.md`):

```sh
# Rust (needs rustup; targets wasm32-unknown-unknown, aarch64-apple-ios, aarch64-linux-android)
cd spikes/pdf-basics/rust
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
scripts/check-targets.sh                               # everything: cross-target checks, wasm build, fmt, clippy, tests
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown  # wasm loaded by the TS tests

# TypeScript (Node ≥ 20, pnpm)
cd spikes/pdf-basics/ts
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test               # WASM interop tests run once the Rust wasm is built
pnpm size                                              # min+gz bundle size
```

Rust code follows the `rust-best-practices` skill (no `unwrap`/`expect` in library code, clippy clean with `-D warnings`). Library code in both languages is bytes-in/bytes-out: no file system, network or Node-only APIs, so it runs on web, mobile and desktop.
