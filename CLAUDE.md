# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and humans) working in this repository.

## What lamina is

lamina is a platform for anything and everything PDF: creating PDFs from code, parsing and extracting content, rendering, editing, form filling, signing, and transforming documents. The project is in its **research phase** — there is no application code yet. The core language, architecture and scope have not been decided; don't assume them. When they are decided, they'll be recorded as ADRs in `docs/decisions/` and summarized here.

## Working agreements

- **Pull requests only.** `main` was initialized directly; every change since goes through a branch + PR. Branch names: `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g. `docs/pdf-research`).
- **Conventional Commits** for commit messages: `type(scope): summary`.
- **Document as you go.** Plans go in `docs/plans/`, decisions in `docs/decisions/`, research in `docs/research/`. Update the folder's `README.md` index whenever you add a file.
- **Cite sources.** PDF behavior claims should point to ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0) or another primary source. Clearly label recommendations and opinions.
- **Spec first.** When implementing PDF features, read the relevant research chapter in `docs/research/` and the spec section before writing code. Real-world PDFs are frequently malformed — parsers must be tolerant, writers must be strict.
- **Mind licenses.** Many PDF libraries are AGPL or dual-licensed (e.g. iText, MuPDF/PyMuPDF). Don't add a dependency without checking its license.

## Commands

Only research spikes exist so far (`spikes/`). They are throwaway-quality APIs used to inform decisions, not the product.

`spikes/pdf-basics/` — the same minimal PDF core in Rust and TypeScript (see its `SPEC.md`):

```sh
# Rust (needs rustup; targets wasm32-unknown-unknown, aarch64-apple-ios, aarch64-linux-android)
cd spikes/pdf-basics/rust
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
scripts/check-targets.sh                               # everything: cross-target checks, wasm build, fmt, clippy, tests
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown  # wasm loaded by the TS tests

# TypeScript (Node ≥ 20, pnpm)
cd spikes/pdf-basics/ts
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test               # WASM interop tests run once the Rust wasm is built
pnpm size                                              # min+gz bundle size
```

Rust code follows the `rust-best-practices` skill (no `unwrap`/`expect` in library code, clippy clean with `-D warnings`). Library code in both languages is bytes-in/bytes-out: no file system, network or Node-only APIs, so it runs on web, mobile and desktop.
